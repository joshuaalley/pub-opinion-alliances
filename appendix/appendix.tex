\section{Marginal Mean Alliance Support by Foreign Policy Disposition} 


The manuscript reports analyses with partisan subgroups, as well as foreign policy dispositions within each party. 
In this section of the appendix, I report subgroup analyses by foreign policy disposition across partisanship. 
\autoref{fig:hawk-plots} and \autoref{fig:isolation-plots} show the distribution of alliance attitudes for hawkishness and isolationism. 


First, hawkish individuals are more likely to support alliance formation and maintenance, regardless of specific alliance characteristics. 
Hawks are also more responsive to cues from Republican Senators and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Doves pay more attention to cues from Democratic Senators.
The results in the manuscript clearly show the sources of these partisan differences, as Republicans are usually more hawkish.

The rightmost panel plots the difference between these groups. Components marked with abbreviated labels to make the plot more legible.}

\end{figure}


Isolationism does not reduce baseline support for alliances, but it does change individual responses to elite cues. 
Internationalist respondents are more receptive to elite cues, as \autoref{fig:isolation-plots} shows. 
Although isolationists and internationalists have similar levels of support for alliance participation across most alliance attribute, marginal mean support among internationalists diverges strongly in response to elite support or opposition. 
As a result, isolationists have higher alliance support than internationalists when elites oppose treaty formation.

\section{Treatment Interactions and Alternative Profile Distributions}


\citet{delaCuestaetal2021} observe that the distribution of profiles can affect inferences, especially when assuming a uniform distribution of profiles is problematic.
Although all the alliance profiles are feasible, some may be more likely than others. 
To investigate how this effects the AMCE estimates, I implemented the model based exploratory analysis recommendations of \citet{delaCuestaetal2021}. 


\autoref{tab:conjoint-vars-margins} summarizes the assumed marginal distributions of the different alliance attributes. 
I used data from the ATOP project \citep{Leedsetal2002} to measure the frequency of different alliance treaty obligations. 
I then make alternative assumptions about elite cues, starting with less consistent support from Republican Senators, relative to Democratic Senators, military leaders and diplomats. 
I then use the observed distribution of U.S. trade ties, the distribution of allied military capability and U.S. ally democracy to approximate the population frequency of these attributes. 
I also assume that serious common threats are unusual. 
Data on recent military cooperation is based on the size of the coalition of the willing in Iraq as a share of states in the international system. 
The assumed population distribution of financial costs is based on \citep{AlleyFuhrmann2021}.

\caption{Table of alliance attributes in conjoint experiment profiles with alternative frequency assumptions. Frequencies for model-based population average marginal component effect estimation in bold. I use the same set of attributes as treatments in the alliance formation and maintenance experiments.} 
\label{tab:conjoint-vars-margins}
\end{table}


I use the marginal distribution of alliance attributes in \autoref{tab:conjoint-vars-margins} as the target distribution for the alliance formation experiment, but use a different procedure for the maintenance experiment. 
Rather than use an assumed distribution, I check the maintenance results using data from observed U.S. alliances as the target distribution. 
In this analysis, I use data from U.S. alliance partners in 2018 to measure the prevalence of democracy, trade ties, military capability, threat and treaty obligations. 


The population AMCE analysis has some disadvantages. 
In particular, the subgroup analyses of partisanship and foreign policy dispositions are less straightforward. 
Furthermore, I must omit the region attribute in the observed data estimates of the alliance maintenance AMCES, given the lack of U.S. alliances in Africa. 
I also have to select conditions on military support or defense cooperation values in alliances with more than one value for these attributes. 
For example, NATO has basing rights and an international organization, and I select basing rights as it is more consequential.  
Establishing the population of elite cues also required some assumptions about which alliances military and diplomatic elites would likely oppose.
While Democrat and Republican Senators have expressed skepticism of some U.S. alliances, military and diplomatic elites are usually more reticent, but some cases with opposition are necessary for this analysis. 


% quick overview of results 
\autoref{fig:pop-amce-main} and \autoref{fig:pop-amce-form} plot the population AMCE estimates, relative to the sample AMCEs reported in the manuscript. 
Even under alternative distributional assumptions, elite cues, allied democracy and financial costs exert substantial influence on alliance maintenance attitudes. 
The population AMCE estimates have much higher uncertainty, so some are not statistically significant at conventional levels, despite estimates in the same direction with greater magnitude.

% summarize differences
There are also some differences between the population and sample AMCE estimates. 
Trade exerts a stronger influence on alliance attitudes under different marginal distributions of the attributes. 
In the alliance formation experiment, elite cues are less influential than allied democracy, trade and capability. 


\section{Open-Ended Alliance Attitudes} 


To further examine the primary sources of alliance attitudes, I asked respondents to identify the most important factors behind their support or opposition to the hypothetical alliances in an open-ended question. 
Roughly half of the respondents gave no response or useless answers, which limits the utility of the responses below. 
It does provide some useful insight into the personal characteristics that predict particular emphases in alliance attitudes, however. 


Based on a reading of the open-ended questions, I created three dummy indicators of general alliance attributes. 
The first takes on a value of one for mentions of elite cues using the generic elite, bipartisan, partisan, military, and diplomatic cues indicators. 
The second has a value of one if a respondent references alliance partner attributes through the trade, regime type, threat, region, recent military cooperation and capability dummies. 
The last indicator captures any mention of alliance obligations, including cost, issue linkages, defense cooperation and conditions on military support. 
These three variables are not mutually exclusive, because respondents often mentioned multiple factors from different categories. 


Because individuals highlight multiple alliance attributes, I analyze the open-ended responses with a Bayesian multivariate probit model, which captures correlations between the different response classes. 
Each equation of the model predicts open-ended response content using individual characteristics, including the strength of individual partisan attachment, international economic interests, gender, race, education, region and income. 
Because the model has many parameters, I employ Bayesian estimation to regularize the estimates.
